# Research Proposal: How the pandamic impacted the supply chain
By Kyra Grodman, Jersey Krupp, and Qiyu Yang

## Research Question
We want to know supply chain network reformed and changed following the pandemic based on customer/supplier contracts from SEC filings. We hypothesize that digital/technology companies will increase as sellers.

## Necessary Data
1. This dataset should cover:
  - SEC contracts from 2019 and 2022
  - An observation is a firm-year
  - The sample period is 2019 & 2022
  - The sample conditions: 2019 & 2022, include all industries, maybe limit the amount of firms we look at??
    - SP 500, start at technology intustries and see where the connections lead, other big supply chain companies (Walmart, Target, etc.)   
  - We would like SEC Exhibit 10s,  maybe 10Ks
2. We will need SEC Exhibit 10s & maybe 10Ks
3. ?? based on results of our sample data?? - to see what other companies/firms to use
4. raw inputs: the names of buyers and sellers in 2019 & 2022
    1. Will store the E10 & maybe 10Ks in zip folders
    2. Will store the scraped data in dataframes
5. Similar to the midterm
    1. Figure out which companies to look at
    2. Use URLs/code from Midterm to obtain the buyers/seller names
    3. Add these to a dataframe
    4. Analyze the results
    5. Convert results into a dashbaord

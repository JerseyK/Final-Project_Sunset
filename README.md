Initial Idea
- Identify customer/supplier contracts from SEC filings and build a dashboard visualization exploring how the supply chain network reformed and changed following the pandemic.
  - Collect SEC exhibit 10 files for 2019 and 2022. Restrict to customer/supplier contracts. Decide which firm is buyer and which is seller. Augment with 10-K based CustSupplier data. Compare/contrast the Exhibit10 data with 10-K based data.
